# Jasper

A bot that was created for someone who didn't deserve it, who then attempted to steal it and then I proceeded
to de-brand the entire thing :^)

It's written in Java, using [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).

## Features

+ The expected utility command suite.
+ Music functionality using Lavaplayer.
+ Member Leave/Join logging.
+ Channel/Conversation archival and export.

## Installation

1. Download from the Releases, or compile with `maven clean package`.
2. Run `Jasper-x.x.jar` in an empty directory.
3. Create a new MariaDB(**Not** MySQL) database.
4. Open and configure the generated `config.yml`.
5. Run `Jasper-x.x.jar` again.

## Credits

#### Laika - Creator and Maintainer
#### A few other people, who won't be named because they wrote a grand total of ~100-200 lines of code (out of the 2,000) and a bullshit license agreement.
